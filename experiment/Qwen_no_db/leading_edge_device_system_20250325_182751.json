      "description": "The Leading Edge Device System is designed to enhance lift and control during low-speed flight phases, such as takeoff and landing, by modifying the wing's aerodynamic profile. This system deploys leading-edge slats and Krueger flaps to increase the wing's curvature and delay stall, ensuring stable airflow at high angles of attack. It integrates with the aircraft's flight control systems to automate deployment based on flight phase and speed, while prioritizing structural integrity and fail-safe mechanisms.",
