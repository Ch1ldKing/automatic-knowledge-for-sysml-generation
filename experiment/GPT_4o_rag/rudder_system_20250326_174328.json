It ensures accurate directional control with a deflection accuracy of ±0.1°. The rudder material is made of high-grade composites with a tensile strength of over 1500 MPa to withstand high aerodynamic forces. It operates within a temperature range of -40°C to +85°C and is resistant to corrosion. The aerodynamic profile is streamlined with optimized curvature for optimal airflow and minimal drag. The system emphasizes rapid response, precision in deflection, structural integrity under variable loads, and integrated fail-safe controls. It is also designed for ease of maintenance and resistance to environmental wear.",
