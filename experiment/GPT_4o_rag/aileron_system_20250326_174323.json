  "rag_context": "The Aileron Actuator is a precision electromechanical device designed for adjusting the aileron deflection for roll control. It integrates robust control electronics with high-performance mechanical subsystems, including an electric motor, a transmission gearbox, and position feedback sensors. The actuator is required to respond within a maximum time interval of <50ms, operate within an environmental temperature range of -40°C to +85°C, and be powered by a standard nominal voltage of 28V DC. It must also ensure precise movement accuracy of ±0.1° to accurately translate control commands. Additionally, the actuator features redundant design features for continued operation in case of component failures and employs Dual/Triple Modular Redundancy for enhanced safety and reliability.",
