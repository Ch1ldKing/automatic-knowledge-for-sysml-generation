      "description": "The Speed Brake System is an aerodynamically actuated system designed to deploy and retract speed brake panels on the aircraft's wings or fuselage to increase drag and reduce airspeed during flight. It operates in coordination with flight control systems to manage deceleration during approach, landing, or in-flight maneuvers. The system ensures controlled deployment angles, symmetrical operation, and structural integrity under high aerodynamic loads. It incorporates redundancy, fail-safe mechanisms, and real-time monitoring to prevent asymmetric deployment and maintain stability. The design prioritizes rapid response, minimal mechanical wear, and compatibility with hydraulic or electromechanical actuation systems.",
