It ensures rapid activation, operational reliability, and robust fail-safe measures. The system interfaces seamlessly with the central control unit and emergency lighting modules to promptly trigger evacuation signals during critical situations. The system has specific attributes such as response time of 3 seconds, operating temperature range of -20°C to 70°C, triple modular redundancy for fault tolerance, MTBF of 20000 hours, and dual power supply with battery backup for energy requirements. Additionally, it has requirements related to evacuation activation, response performance, fail-safe and redundancy, and interface and maintainability. The system components include managing safe evacuation protocols, automated door release mechanisms, and redundant sensor and actuator circuits for operational integrity.",
