      "description": "The Spoiler System is a critical flight control subsystem responsible for modulating aerodynamic lift and drag during flight. It consists of deployable surfaces on the wings that disrupt airflow to reduce lift, enhance roll control, and assist in ground deceleration. The system operates in coordination with ailerons for roll augmentation, acts as speed brakes in-flight, and deploys fully as ground spoilers post-landing. Design priorities include rapid deployment, precise angular control, structural resilience under high aerodynamic loads, and seamless integration with flight control computers. The system incorporates redundancy, fault detection, and environmental hardening to ensure reliability across all flight phases.",
