      "description": "The Flap System is a critical subsystem of the Flight Surfaces, responsible for modulating lift and drag during takeoff, landing, and high-lift maneuvers. It consists of deployable surfaces on the wings that extend or retract to alter aerodynamic profiles. The system ensures optimal lift-to-drag ratios, enhances low-speed stability, and reduces stall speeds. Designed for high reliability, it integrates redundant actuation mechanisms, real-time position feedback, and robust load-bearing structures to withstand dynamic pressures and cyclic fatigue over the aircraft’s operational lifespan.",
