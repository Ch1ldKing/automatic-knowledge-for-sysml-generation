  "rag_context": "The Fuel Delivery System is designed to precisely regulate and distribute fuel to critical aerodynamic surfaces. It ensures optimal fuel flow, monitoring, and safety even under dynamically varying altitude, pressure, and temperature conditions. The system must precisely control the fuel flow rate and pressure to meet the varying demands during different phases of flight including takeoff, cruise, and landing. The fuel pump must deliver fuel at a pressure range between 3-5 Bar with a flow rate that supports rapid engine response in emergency maneuvers. Safety mechanisms such as overpressure shutoff, leak detection sensors, and isolation valves are included to prevent fuel spills and fire hazards. The system is designed for high reliability, ease of maintenance, and long service intervals, with a failure rate that meets or exceeds aviation industry standards.",
