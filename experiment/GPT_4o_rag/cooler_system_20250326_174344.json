  "rag_context": "The Cooler System is a dedicated component of the aircraft’s environmental control system designed to rapidly and accurately lower cabin temperature when conditions exceed the defined comfort threshold. It integrates a compressor, condenser, evaporator, expansion valve, and cooling fan. The system is engineered for high efficiency, quick response, and robust safety redundancy to ensure minimal temperature deviation and seamless integration with the central Control Unit and Air Handling Unit. The Cooler System actively reduces cabin temperature when ambient conditions exceed 26°C by initiating the refrigeration cycle. It must achieve the required temperature reduction within 5 seconds upon detection of a temperature deviation to ensure optimum cabin comfort. Fail-safe measures, including redundant sensor feedback and compressor bypass, are incorporated to ensure continuous operation even in the event of component failure.",
