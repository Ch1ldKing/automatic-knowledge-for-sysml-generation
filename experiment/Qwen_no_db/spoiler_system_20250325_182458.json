      "description": "The Spoiler System is designed to reduce lift, control descent rates, and manage aircraft deceleration during flight phases such as landing and turbulence. It operates by deploying spoiler panels to disrupt airflow over the wings, converting lift into drag. The system integrates with the Flight Control Module to synchronize with other control surfaces like flaps and ailerons. Key design priorities include rapid deployment, precise force application, structural resilience under cyclic loading, and fail-safe operation in extreme environmental conditions.",
